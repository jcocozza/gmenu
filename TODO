- implement a fuzzy search
- exec flag?
    - run the "exec" command with the selected value passed in
- font:
    - more cleanly organize the font/ dir
    - make the font/text more legible; not sure why it is so fuzzy (especially when highlighted)
- asynchronously populate list of elements (this is good for large inputs)
- case insensitive
